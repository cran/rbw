Description: Residual balancing is a robust method of constructing weights for
  marginal structural models, which can be used to estimate (a) the average treatment effect in 
  a cross-sectional observational study, (b) controlled direct/mediator effects in causal mediation
  analysis, and (c) the effects of time-varying treatments in panel data (Zhou and Wodtke 2020
  <doi:10.1017/pan.2020.2>). This package provides three functions, rbwATE(), rbwMed(), and rbwPanel(),
  that produce residual balancing weights for estimating (a), (b), (c), respectively.
